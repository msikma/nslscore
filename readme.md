# NSL 6 Scoreboard

Casting scoreboard app for NSL 6. Created for the nOm clan.

## Setup

Add the scoreboard as a **Browser Source** in OBS or another streaming program. It's assumed that the streamer's **Canvas Resolution** is set to **1920x1080px**.

| Setting | Value |
|:--------|:------|
| Source URL | https://msikma.github.io/nslscore/ |
| Width | 1920 |
| Height | 1540 |

The top of the scoreboard is the control panel section (it's 460px high), and the bottom is the casting section.

Move the **Browser Source** up **460px** (move it up so that it snaps to the bottom of the screen). This will cause the control panel section to be completely off-screen, while the casting section appears pixel perfect at the right place.

## Usage

After setting up the scoreboard, select the **Browser Source** and click the **Interact** button in OBS. This opens up a window that lets you interact with the scoreboard. Keep this window open while casting.
